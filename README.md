# Hey there! 👋 I'm Carlos

**System Administrator & DevOps Consultant** who loves tinkering with servers, containerizing everything, and building cool stuff on the web.

## 🚀 What I Do

I'm a consultant specializing in **system administration** and **DevOps**, helping businesses streamline their infrastructure and deployment processes. When I'm not optimizing servers or writing automation scripts, you'll find me crafting web applications or fine-tuning my home lab setup.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages I speak fluently:**
- 🐚 Bash (and POSIX shell in general)
- 🐍 Python
- ☕ Java
- 🐘 PHP
- ⚡ JavaScript

**Frameworks & Tools:**
- Node.js
- Laravel
- Docker (my favorite! 🐳)
- Linux servers (my natural habitat 🐧)

## 🎯 Featured Projects

### 🎵 [MusicPrints](https://musicprints.conputer.org)
A web application I built and host on my own home server - because why not combine passion for music with tech skills?

### 🖥️ Linux Environments
- **[BSPWM Dotfiles](https://github.com/pineedaa/dotfiles-bspwm)** - My tiling window manager setup
- **[Hyprland Dotfiles](https://github.com/pineedaa/dotfiles-hyprland)** - Because variety is the spice of life

### 🏠 Home Server
I run my own home server where I host MusicPrints and various services I use daily. It's like having a mini data center at home! 

## 🎯 Current Interests

- 🐳 **Docker & Containerization** - Making deployments smooth as butter
- ⚙️ **DevOps Practices** - Automating all the things
- 🚀 **Infrastructure as Code** - Because manual setups are so last decade

## 💪 When I'm Not Coding

- 🥊 **Muay Thai** - Breaking boards and debugging code with equal intensity
- 🧗 **Rock Climbing** - Scaling both mountains and server architectures
- 💪 **Calisthenics** - Building strength, one pull-up at a time
- 🏃‍♂️ **Running** - Sometimes from production bugs, sometimes just for fun
